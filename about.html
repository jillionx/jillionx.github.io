    <h1>A little more about me...</h1>
    <p class="lead">I am currently finishing up an A.A.S. in Computer Information Systems, with a previously completed degree of Chemistry Calculus-Based Physics. 
        My extensive math background and previous degree kept me from pursuing a Computer Science degree (only two additional degree requirements for the piece of paper? 
        no thanks!). The flexibility in my CIS program has allowed me to specialize in programming courses, but also gain additional experience in Technical Writing 
        and more advanced concepts for Computer Operating Systems.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">I started with web development in 2002, but the inability for many people to take women in programming seriously kept me from pursuing any sort of development 
        as my career path when I first completed high school. While the percentage of women in the field may have gone down, I'm no longer letting that stop me.
